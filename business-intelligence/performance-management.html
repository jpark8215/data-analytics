                            <strong>Performance management</strong> has advanced markedly with the integration of business intelligence (BI), AI, and analytics. Organizations deploying modern BI-enhanced performance management achieve significantly better employee outcomes, process efficiency, and evidence-based decision-making. Notably, recent <em>Harvard Business Review</em> analyses and Gartner research (2024–2025) indicate AI-enabled systems correlate with up to 40% higher retention, 50% greater goal alignment, and major improvements in feedback quality and timing.

                                <strong>Automated Data Collection & Analysis:</strong>
                                Modern platforms use AI and analytics to aggregate performance data from work systems (e.g., collaboration tools, project management, communication platforms), automate trend analysis, and highlight development opportunities while mitigating rater bias.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Real-Time Dashboards & Predictive Analytics:</strong>
                                BI dashboards provide managers and HR with up-to-date metrics on goal progress, skills gaps, and risk of attrition, while predictive analytics enables targeted interventions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2. Continuous Feedback and Development</h3>
                        <ul>
